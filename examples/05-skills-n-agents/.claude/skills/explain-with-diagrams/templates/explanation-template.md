# Explanation Template

Use this structure for all code explanations.

---

## 1. Analogy

> **"It's like a ___"**
>
> Start with a real-world analogy that maps to the code's behavior.
> Keep it to 2-3 sentences. The reader should go "oh, I get it" immediately.

## 2. ASCII Diagram

```
Draw a diagram here showing:
- Key components as boxes
- Data flow as arrows (─▶)
- Decision points as diamonds or branches
- Keep it under 20 lines wide and 15 lines tall
```

## 3. Code Walkthrough

Walk through the code step by step:

1. **Line X-Y**: What happens first and why
2. **Line A-B**: The core logic — explain the _why_, not just the _what_
3. **Line C-D**: How the result gets returned

Reference specific line numbers. Quote short snippets where helpful.

## 4. Gotcha

> **Watch out:** Describe one specific, non-obvious pitfall.
>
> This should be something that would trip up a developer who only
> skimmed the code. Be concrete — reference the exact line or behavior.

# Demo Project (Claude Code)

This file is the **router**. It's always loaded into context. Keep it small.

## Rules (Always Apply)

- Python files only
- Follow PEP 8 naming conventions
- All files must have a module docstring

## Documentation Routing

| Topic      | Doc                                        |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|
| API design | [docs/api-design.md](docs/api-design.md)   |
| Testing    | [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md)         |

### Quick Lookup

- "API" / "endpoint" → `docs/api-design.md`
- "test" / "pytest" → `docs/testing.md`

### Hard Imports (always loaded)
